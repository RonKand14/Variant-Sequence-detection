# Variant-Sequence-detection

The following Code was used to create a method to classify a variant out of a viral sample quickly and efficiently. 
The ability to so with high accuracy can contribute to the analysis and prediction of a viral pandemic and its origin. 
To tackle this classification problem, I choose the 1D Convolution network design approach. 
As I intended to represent the data as a 1D vector, using a 1-D convolutional design can be faster than using other more complex designs and can compensate the large number of classes that should be classified.
